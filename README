Usage: fmtx [options] file...

Options:
    -c        center on line
    -h        help text
    -s        replace tabs with spaces
    -w width  width of line

This program will wrap text to a given width (default 80).

It maintains the indent.

It maintains the initial comment:

    # like shell comments
    // or C comments
    >> or email quotations

It maintains bullets and numbering:

    * like this
    - or this
    1. or like this
    a. or this
    IX. or this

In the original fmt program, if you edit a comment like this:

    # comment here thats too long for one line

It wouldn't print the comment on the wrapped line:

    # comment here thats
    too long for one line

If you edited a comment already on multiple lines, it would put the # somewhere in the middle of a line:

    # comment here thats
    # on several
    # lines

Like this:

    # comment here thats # on several #
    lines
